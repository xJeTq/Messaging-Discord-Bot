The final project for my AP Computer Science A class permitted the students to select any project they wanted to work on. Since I am an avid Discord user, I wanted to create a bot that my friends and I could interact with. Not only that but creating this bot exposed me to a new language I had not known at the time: Python. I attached the project files in this repository, as well as other resources I utilized. One thing that I should mention is hosting the bot. In order to implement bots into a Discord server, the bot needs to be hosted online. I used a free site called "UpTime" that hosts servers free of charge. I will link that site as well.
